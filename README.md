# Task
A simple yet powerful lexical analyzer implemented using Flex. The primary goal of this analyzer is to break down input text into individual words while counting them. The lex specification file defines rules to recognize words (sequences of letters) and discard other characters. Inside the yylex() function, we not only print each word as it's encountered but also maintain a running count of words. This allows us to efficiently count the number of words in the input text. The final word count is displayed in the main() function, making it a valuable tool for analyzing text and extracting word statistics. The code can be easily adapted for various text processing tasks and serves as a helpful example of using Flex to perform lexical analysis with real-time word counting.
